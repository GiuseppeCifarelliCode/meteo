First complex project in React to prove what I learned in the past two days.

### `npm i`
Install all the dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `json-server --watch db.json --port 3001 json-server-auth`
Runs my local db in port:3001
